List of dorks to use with Google Search to find organizations leaking PII

## What is PII?
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as: Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. (source: [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii#:~:text=Personal%20Identifiable%20Information%20(PII)%20is,either%20direct%20or%20indirect%20means.))

## How to use
Usage is pretty simple: go to the country you'd like, pick a dork from the md file and pop it into Google.

You can also use this other tool I authored named [Octopii](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/Octopii) to extract PII.
